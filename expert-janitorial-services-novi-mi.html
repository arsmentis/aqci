            <p>Though the saying goes &lsquo;looks are only skin deep,&rsquo; an
              unclean workplace makes any business appear less professional.
              Choosing a professional cleaning crew to service your building or
              work area makes all the difference for employee morale and
              customers who visit. By opting for our service, you won&rsquo;t
              need to worry about picking up or deep cleaning from <a

              cleaning to <a
                href="cleaning-services/carpet-upholstery-cleaning.html">carpet</a>
              and upholstery cleaning. When local businesses in Novi work with
              us, we treat them like a family.</p>
            <h3>Novi, MI - A Welcoming Community for Businesses and People</h3>
            <p>Less than 30 miles outside of Detroit you will find Novi,
              <strong>a cultural and economic hub in Oakland County.</strong>
              Researchers have taken notice of what a great place Novi is.
              Safety makes all the difference in an area where you live and work
              - a reason Novi is proud to have been named the 25th safest city
              in Michigan according to <a
                href="https://www.alarms.org/safest-cities-in-michigan/">Alarms.org</a>.
              <a
                href="http://money.com/money/collection/2018-best-places-to-live/5361472/novi-michigan-2/">Money
                Magazine</a> ranked Novi as the 23rd best city in America and
              the best city in Michigan to live for its low unemployment (1.8%
              in 2017), shopping options, high average income, and
              family-friendly amenities.</p>
            <p>Novi has been welcoming a diverse group of residents, visitors,
              and businesses since before it became a city in 1969. With more
              than 60 companies based in Japan having locations in Novi
              including Toyota Boshoku America and Japanese schools, it is clear
              to see why Owani, Japan considers Novi to be a sister city.
              Additionally, other car retailers or manufacturers, energy
              companies, and healthcare organizations such as St. John&rsquo;s
              Providence Health System call Novi home.</p>
            <p><strong>In addition to the top-ranked public school district and
                95% graduation rate</strong>, Novi is the proud home of <a
                href="https://www.walshcollege.edu/">Walsh College&rsquo;s</a>
              technology-enriched campus. The sprawling college property
              includes 35,000 square foot of classrooms, open computer labs, a
              library, bookstore, student lounge, and meeting space provides a
              complete educational experience for residents of Oakland and Wayne
              counties. Find Walsh college&rsquo;s Novi campus just off I-96 and
              Meadowbrook Road.</p>
            <p>Look no further than Novi for both indoor and outdoor things to
              do. Go for a swim in the nearby Walled Lake than when the leaves
              begin to turn, stop by <a
                href="https://www.yatescidermill.com/">Yates Cider Mill</a> just
              outside the city for delicious treats. Head inside of <a
                href="https://www.shoptwelveoaks.com/">Twelve Oaks Mall</a> to

            <h3>Lose the Stress with Cleaning Services You Can Trust</h3>
            <p>Here at American Quality Cleaning, we have worked with clients
              dissatisfied with previous cleaning services that have had. These
              clients hated their experience with unreliable service - clients
              whose workers were late, some areas were left unclean, the areas
              that were cleaned were done poorly. We were just as horrified as
              they were.</p>
            <p>Not only do we thoroughly train our staff on the correct cleaning
              techniques, but we also have regular, on-site inspections to make
              sure our service delivery is top quality. Whether we are window
              cleaning or working on carpeting and upholstery, <strong>we use
                premium cleaning products</strong> to get out the worst stains
              or accidents. With us, you will never have to say, &ldquo;you
              missed a spot.&rdquo;</p>
