            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <hr class="thick">
            <p>American Quality Cleaning, Inc. recognizes the importance of
              protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our
              web sites, subscribers to our services, registrants for our
              events, and all other customers of our products and services. We
              created this policy with a fundamental respect for our customers'
              right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our
              customers. This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices
              for all products and services owned by American Quality Cleaning,
              Inc..</p>
            <h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
            <p>American Quality Cleaning, Inc. collects information from our
              website users, subscribers and other customers. In this section of
              our Privacy Statement, we describe the type of information we
              collect and how we use it to provide better services to our
              customers.</p>
            <h4>Registration and Ordering</h4>
            <p>Using our website and signing up for certain selected services
              (such as personal business lists), users must first register.
              During registration, users are required to give their contact
              information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and
              phone number). For internal purposes, we use this information to
              communicate with users and provide requested services, and, for
              our website visitors, to provide a more personalized experience on
              our sites. We also may collect demographic information. We use
              aggregate demographic information about our audience to improve
              our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting
              purposes.</p>
            <p>Many of our products and services are free to subscribers who
              meet certain demographic criteria. Independent auditors may need
              to certify the eligibility of these subscribers. In order to do
              that, we may collect unique identifiers (such as mother's maiden
              name) that we disclose to the auditors strictly for industry
              reporting and audit verification purposes.</p>
            <p>For our services that require payment (Business Subscriptions),
              we also collect credit card information (such as account name,
              number and expiration date), which is used for our or our agent's
              billing purposes only, and is not otherwise shared.</p>
            <h4>Surveys and Contests</h4>
            <p>From time to time we invite web site users and other customers to
              provide information via surveys or contests. Participation in
              these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the website
              user or other customer therefore has a choice whether to disclose
              requested contact information (such as name and mailing address)
              and demographic information (such as zip code or job title). In
              addition to the other uses set forth in this policy, contact
              information collected in connection with surveys and contests is
              used to notify the winners and award prizes and to monitor or
              improve the use of, and satisfaction with the website or other
              American Quality Cleaning, Inc. product or service. Subject to the
              given customer's preferences (as described in the "Permission"
              section below), such information also may be shared with third
              party sponsors of such surveys or contests.</p>
            <h4>Tell-A-Friend</h4>
            <p>If customers elect to use our referral service for informing a
              friend about our sites and services, we may ask them for the
              friend's name, interests and e-mail address. American Quality
              Cleaning, Inc. will store and use this information to send the
              friend an invitation. This information may also be used to provide
              information about our company and related products and services.
              The friend may contact us as specified in the tell-a-friend
              message to request that no further communications be sent.</p>
            <h4>Communications with Us</h4>
            <p>We have features where our customers can submit information to us
              (such as our feedback forms). Where such submissions include
              requests for service, support or information, we may forward them
              to our agents, as needed, to best respond to the specific request.
              In addition, we may retain e-mails and other information sent to
              us for our internal administrative purposes, and to help us to
              serve customers better. Please note that letters to the editor and
              similar submissions may be made public, unless they refer to
              current registered businesses, in which case information is not
              disclosed.</p>
            <h4>Communications from Us: Service Updates, Special Offers</h4>
            <p>American Quality Cleaning, Inc. will never send email
              notifications to users unless they specifically request so.</p>
            <h4>Automatic Data Collection</h4>
            <p>American Quality Cleaning, Inc. has features that automatically
              collect information from customers, to deliver content specific to
              customers' interests and to honor their preferences. This
              information assists us in creating products and services that will
              serve the needs of our customers.</p>
            <p>For example, we use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the
              user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies
              benefit the user by requiring login only once, thereby saving time
              while on our web site. If users reject the cookies, they may be
              limited in the use of some areas of our web site. For example, the
              user may not be able to participate in sweepstakes, contests or
              drawings.</p>
            <p>For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type,
              navigation history and IP address of all visitors to our web
              sites. This information does not contain anything that can
              identify users personally. We use this information for our
              internal security audit log, trend analysis and system
              administration, and to gather broad demographic information about
              our user base for aggregate use.</p>
            <p>We may combine demographic information supplied by a customer at
              registration with web site usage data to provide general profiles,
              in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our customers
              and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising.
              We may share this composite information with our advertisers and
              business affiliates to help them better understand our services.
            </p>
            <p>Other than as set forth above, we do not share personally
              identifiable information with other companies, apart from those
              acting as our agents in providing our product(s)/service(s), and
              which agree to use it only for that purpose and to keep the
              information secure and confidential. Also, our parent, subsidiary
              and affiliate companies, entities into which our company may be
              merged, or entities to which any of our assets, products, sites or
              operations may be transferred, will be able to use personal
              information. We will also disclose information we maintain when
              required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court
              order or a subpoena or other legal obligation, in response to a
              law enforcement agency's request, or in special cases when we have
              reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to
              identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be
              causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
              unintentionally) our rights or property. Users should also be
              aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might
              have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal
              information to be shared or transferred to third parties without
              permission.</p>
            <p>We may share aggregate information, which is not personally
              identifiable, with others. This information may include usage and
              demographic data, but it will not include personal information.
            </p>
            <h4>Permission</h4>
            <p>Our customers are given the opportunity to choose whether to
              receive information from our affiliates and us not directly
              related to the product or service for which they registered (or
              which they otherwise agreed to receive). Customers also have the
              opportunity to choose whether to have personal information shared
              with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>Please note that we will endeavor to implement your permission
              requests within a reasonable time, although for a time you may
              continue to receive mailings, etc., transmitted based on
              information released prior to the implementation of your request.
              In addition, please note that even after such request is
              implemented, your page will continue to update information
              directly related to the service for which you registered (or which
              you otherwise agreed to receive), so you always are kept updated.
            </p>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p>We use reasonable precautions to protect our customers' personal
              information and to store it securely. Sensitive information that
              is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number, only
              applies to Businesses) is encrypted and is transmitted to us
              securely. In addition, access to all of our customers'
              information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above,
              is restricted. Finally, the servers on which we store personally
              identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
            <h4>Links</h4>
            <p>American Quality Cleaning, Inc. may contain links to other sites.
              American Quality Cleaning, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy
              practices or content of such other sites. We encourage our users
              to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
              statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect
              personally identifiable information.</p>
            <h4>Children</h4>
            <p>American Quality Cleaning, Inc. websites are not directed at
              individuals under thirteen years of age, and American Quality
              Cleaning, Inc. does not intend to collect any
              personally-identifiable information from such individuals.</p>
            <h4>Notification and Changes</h4>
            <p>If we change our Privacy Statement, we will post those changes on
              this page so our users are aware of what information we collect,
              how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose
              it. Users should check this policy frequently to keep abreast of
              any changes.</p>
